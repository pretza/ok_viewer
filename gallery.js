I've only ever shared my feelings and been completely transparent about myself. What could possibly be left for me to do? Between my counselor and my wife, two people I can trust would disagree with that sentiment, so I must now question how much of me is under subconscious influence. I need to dig deeper inside of me than ever before, deeper than I knew I could dig. </p><p>I have no idea what this is going to do for my art, but I'm definitely afraid of regressing. My wife is worried I'll kill myself, my counselor thinks I've had something stuck deep inside of me since childhood, and he was almost crying at how sad our marriage and upbringings are.

Despite my aim, its posture and demeanor suggested little interest in sexual provocation. Now it is returning my gaze in judgment, disappointment, and humiliation. The direct nature of the image grew out of my control, and the character received a life of its own, yet again, outside of my intentions.

I was terrified of being damaging or selfish or shallow, or becoming another artist that was motivated by a sex drive before anything else. At the time, I would have felt like my life was squandered. Six years later, I found out how to create art that was honest enough to deal with my sexual desires but grounded-enough to also express a full context. </p>The stressful night mentioned in the older notes was after my friend Lauren had killed herself.

Those who kept up with the topic should note this is a big deal. Some limit outside of myself would always twist my porn into something unpornographic, something compelling and convicting. However, on this particular night, the emotional/spiritual limit that kept me from drawing straight-up pornographic images didn't exist. I drew whatever I found to be the most sexually driven at the time.</i></p><p><i>As part of my recovery group, which I've affectionately dubbed \"Sad Fappers Anonymous\", I'm listening to this audiobook:</p><p>Surfing For God: Discovering the Divine Desire Beneath Sexual Urge</p><p><i>It's as cringe-y as you'd expect from the title, so that help me go in with low expectations.

Every professional opinion must say that porn is about more than an orgasm or fulfilling a sex-drive. Every time I hear one of those quotes, it reminds me that I'd rather read something from these guys than the author. And certainly if I was talking to the author in person, he'd be patronizing to approach me in the way this book does. This book is full of cultural rhetoric and anecdotal musings on masculinity and God's \"natural design\" for us. The author would never expect that me, as a man in a straight marriage, would feel his most masculine when I meditate on my preferred porn on fantasize about getting physical with a strong, older mentor-type man. The Bible gives us few mutually exclusive character traits applying only gender, so I wish the author would address gender roles/norms and what Scriptural limits [there are], rather than being yet another self-help \"Men Cooking Outdoors for God\" thing.</i></p><p><i>God, to me, is the plurality evident in sacred geometry and metaphysics. A god that, somehow, breaches time and space to have an intimate connection with me. As far as I know it, God is synonymous with truth. This helps me dialogue with others from all walks of life without being overly dogmatic; ignorant but not inane. I know enough about the Bible to know that the God in the Scriptures could never be contained by one book, a few cultural origin points, nor any language of man. What life has taught me so far is that people have more value than their current performance, and that we aren't just animals stuck in infinite cosmos. </i></p><p><i>Discarding my marriage in a pursuit of hedonism/nihilism, or opening my marriage again, are both incompatible with my pursuit of truth.

Just then, the words ``Don't do it'' shot across time and space and hit me in the core of my being.

I've killed my back working on autofellatio, I've torn up my urethra with a sounding mistake gone wrong, and later sutured the opening a bit wider to accept bigger sounds, then used my own blood as lube... I could go on. And at my worst of looking at porn, I was jacking off to real videos of innocent people getting murdered, not even sexual. That was years ago and a short-lived phase, but when I say I'd do anything to get a bigger orgasm and not involve another person, I meant it. </i></p><p><i>Fast forward to my second relationship, my wife. I told her going into this that I'm pretty screwed up and don't want to bring my problems into it. She's mature enough to handle what I tell her without shaming me in any way.

I'm not proud of how I got there, but I'm proud that I confronted my feelings. </p><p>What are the things you're afraid to draw or do that you really desire? What are parts&#160;of you deep down inside that make you truly unlikable? Are you brave-enough to draw those things? Here's my drawing and where it comes from:</p><p>In the sex-positive community of the furry fandom, I hear people say ``Don't kink shame!'' all the time, normally qualified with, ``--I mean, if it's not hurting anyone, it's okay.'' I know for a fact that isn't a good policy:</p><p>This image is referencing a video I downloaded. The video featured two men having sex. I saved it because I thought of masturbating to it earlier. Not a big deal, right? Here's the rest of the context:</p><p>Fetish tier 1: Formatting</p><p>One man was recording with a camera that I'm guessing is mid-to-late 2000s camera phone. He was wearing only a watch and maybe a condom. The video was uploaded to one of those crummy video-hosting sites that aren't at all exclusive for porn. This was a real experience uploaded by a real man, in the video, and it was likely hosted for his pleasure and not for notoriety. Finding this video had the same thrill as accidentally stumbling across internet porn as a child.</p><p>Fetish tier 2: Explicit Content</p><p>The ``top'' was an older muscular dude, tan, no visible face, with cleanly trimmed pubes above a large penis, and was anally penetrating the ``bottom'', a younger clean-shaven man wearing a red thong. The man was clutching some fabric in one hand and some sort of a chemical bottle in the other. His eyes were bloodshot and watering as he was using the fabric and the chemicals to huff. He was clearly having difficulty accepting the well-endowed top, who was also spitting into into his mouth and slapping him in the face (a familiar category in porn called ``facial abuse''). It seemed the floor was bare cement, and the bed was an unfinished set of mattresses. Scene was lit mid-day by a large exposed window with the phone's microphone picking up a breeze outdoors.</p><p>Fetish tier 3: Context</p><p>The build of the man, his watch, the bare cement of the room, he was wearing makes this seem like he was a wealthier person traveling to a developing country to have sex with a young prostitute. I said the bottom was younger, and the truth is in the sex industry he could be any age between puberty and 30. Anything that passes as acceptable for uploading online would be legit. And this makes me wonder how many times I've seen underage content without realizing it. And what's worse is picturing this young man outside the context of this sex act. Is he actually a school boy who hit puberty early? Is he trying to support his family? Is he huffing because he gave up on life, or because the loss in brain cells is better than the pain he goes through each day in this grind? In which set of potential truths do I find a greater amount of sexual arousal? For me, it's the context that includes the greatest amount of suffering and loss.</p><p>At my worst, at my most sexually compromised, I find satisfaction in the destruction of innocent people. I hit this point in 2007, and though I mostly recovered, this video-instance from 2015 was a reminder that I could always go back to those sexual contexts if I wanted to. It's the hardest sexual drug for me that doesn't involve other people directly. It feels good because it breaks my heart, and if I want to, I can empathize with the suffering of the victim and redirect that energy into another part of me.</p><p>This is why I feel so deeply and will love others as much as I can. But this is also why I'd be a serial killer if I wasn't living a life of vulnerability. The art and words I share that save people from killing themselves comes from the same part of me that would otherwise desecrate the gift of life. When I look at serial killers and the people who do things worse than you could imagine, I understand them. I truly feel like he only difference between these ``lost causes'' and myself is that I made some critical life changes that they didn't. </p><p>So now that you know this part of me, you may either relate or know someone who does. In that case, here are some rules to help you segue from a menace to society into someone who can make the world a better place: </p><p>1) Live the rest of your life as truly as possible. Not even white lies.</p><p>2) Admitting that you did something awful is way easier if it's in your past.</p><p>3) Clearly expressing the context of your issues is what will keep society viewing you like a troubled person instead of a monster, so...</p><p>4) Learn where your feelings/urges come from as soon as possible and document it all. </p><p>Do not allow bad secrets to germinate. Dig out those seeds, grind them into pigment, and paint. I painted my picture after taking screen caps of that awful video while I was crying, praying that both men found peace and that I would too.</p>",[["Animus Solo : Loss of Soul/The Broken/broken-A.jpg",0],["Animus Solo : Loss of Soul/The Broken/broken-B.jpg",0]]],["<p>Getting Drunk Notes</p><p>I had this conversation on Facebook in 2015 with one of my friends whom I met as a college suite mate in 2006!

All attempts have been in the throws of depression, mourning, and confusion. And with each attempt, the rendered character seemed to become sovereign, self-aware. The black hare, Resin, was created first from one of these moments, but soon after birthed a desire to understand what I found to be sexually attractive. While I spent the majority of my day scrutinizing everything that sits in front of me, rarely had I equipped a critical lens in the context of my sexual interests. </p><p>I was first introduced to Resin last summer. Outside of that endeavour, I was having a difficult time in my personal life. Art conventions, once a highlight of my life, had since become emotionally turbulent storms to navigate on an almost monthly basis. Relentless emotional sacrifice and empathy was devouring me. This wasn't aimed toward any one individual, but was instead an extreme of the attributes I developed off a previous character design: Stigmata, the rook. </p> <p>Upon rendering his initial concept, I came to understand that Resin was about the physical: sexual activity, health, mental acuity. The theologian Francis Schaeffer mentions the concepts of The Particulars and The Absolutes. Stigmata represented the absolutes in my life, i.e., my pursuit of Truth. Resin was the missing piece: the half that would fulfill my need for comfort, sex, and physical acuity. He would represent my Particulars. </p><p>Having an anthropomorphization of my particulars made me the happiest I had been in recent memory. All my friends noticed the impact it had on me, even if it was subtle. I look at his image and feel a need to become stronger, more structured. And at my best, I feel Stigmata's lessons in my heart but I am my most like Resin in action. I am a better husband, artist, lover, a better human. It seemed consistent with everything I learned from working with other people's character designs, but I hadn't considered using my experiences it to serve me this way until last July. </p><p>The images will be signed with a double-dagger (&#8225;), the same symbol tattooed on my skin.

Here's why this one hurts me the most:</p><p>January 5th, 2015, a day after [one of] our 2 year anniversary[/ies], marked the final time my wife and I were physically intimate together. She was more than willing to do things I enjoyed, but the experience of sexual intercourse was something we almost never mutually enjoyed. The odds were stacked against us: physically, our genitalia were physically incompatible most times; psychologically I was not her type. In hindsight, it felt like, at best, we were settling. At worst we were just performing another household chore the other person would like.</p><p>But I was proud of my ability to perform cunnilingus, and figured if that was the most enjoyable thing for her to experience, and she was great about trying to bring me satisfaction, that was arousing and intimate-enough for me to roll with it. </p><p>January 2015 also marked the first month where we seriously discussed separation. We kept going from having wonderful times together to not knowing how we could possibly live together. We started projecting budgets and Plan Bs, Cs, Ds....</p><p>With this idea of separation always in the background, I promised myself I'd take this opportunity to make our apartment a real home, and make myself a my best individual and husband yet. If it was enough for her to stay, she would. This image was an extension of those wishes for our best year together. Resin is no longer solitary, but engaging in cunnilingus with my wife, like I had pictured myself many times while we were intimate. I had plans to eventually to involve my wife in the creative reference process in the same way I used myself for Resin, but she was too shy and reserved for that. I also knew that creating sexually enticing heterosexual images with Resin further directed my sexuality towards my wife, at the time a huge positive that was also against my grain.  Eventually, this became yet another well-intentioned idea that didn't stick, and by September she and I revisited the separation discussion with a whole new level of resolve. She officially moved out in early December, just a day before I left to sell/teach at MFF.

I considered the idea of Resin performing AF for some time, but my desire to see the concept overrode my ability to keep his original intentions in mind. In this pose, he doesn't appear to be in authority over his ambitions. He doesn't seem aware of his surroundings. It's just a labored blowjob.
